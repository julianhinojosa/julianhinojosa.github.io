    After graduating from Seattle University with a BA in Economics, I entered into the software industry as an Implementation Consultant for GoPlan LLC, a Bellevue WA-based VAR that specilized in selling and implementing the cloud-based enteprise-level FP&A software Adaptive Insights.

     The role benefited a natural attention to detail, but more importantly developed my ability to learn and configure SaaS products while maintaining the positive human-to-human relationships that lay at the heart of successful SaaS engagements.

   <p>
     The next chapter in my life took me to ConnectWise SELL. Known as Quosal prior to their 2016 acqusition by business software company ConnectWise, SELL is known by technology solution providers as the leading quote-to-cash automation platform. In 2017, Connectwise SELL was named on the prestigious Gartner Magic Quadrant for CPQ softwares. With offices in London, Sydney, Seattle, Raleigh, and Tampa, ConnectWise aims to help technology solution providers across the globe better manage their clients, business, and livelihood.

     As a Saas consultant, you quickly learn the following: the easy solution is not always the best solution. I believe that going the extra mile pays off, and that tireless effort is at the foundation of my approach to work and life.

     In my free time, you will often find me discussing tinfoil hat Westworld and Game of Throne theories, volunteering with a local <em>pro bono</em> Immigration Clinic, or doing a bit of vinyl shopping at one Seattle's now-endangered record shops. Friends and family...welcome. Those who mistyped whatever URL you were planning on visiting...welcome. Business folk...you, too, are welcome here. Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal webpage.
