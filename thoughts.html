				<strong>personal lesson of the day:</strong> If you wake up before your alarm, do NOT go back to sleep. You end up feeling better throughout the day when you dont wake up via an alarm/sun/snoring/your upstairs neighbor performing their bi-weekly ritual of rearranging their living room furniture.

        It is about 10:30 am PDT, and at the time of writing, we are somewhere over C Wyoming. Last I checked was 20 minutes ago. I wanted to check again, but the WiFi-based "flight tracker" was not working at the time. Alaska Beyond,  the airlines free magazine, stares back at me as it sits in its little plastic slot. There is probably a map in there, I thought. I see it everytime I feverishly thumb through your pages to find the "games" section, and with it, the easy version of the inevitably airplane-themed crossword puzzle. I am sure there is a map, in fact, I can almost see it through the white and navy themed matte-finish magazine cover with the crime-fighting family The Incredibles splashed across the front. I close my eyes: Yeah, there it is, a few pages after the drink selections and a few pages before the adverts for property in places like Robert, MT, and Fairbanks, AK and, I imagine, C Wyoming, as well.

          At this point, I have to talk a little about the world of free airplane publications. Similar to a mint on your hotel pillow, the significance of such publications is rooted not in the objects themselves, but (1) how the objects ended up there and (2) what the object represents. <br />
          In the case of the hotel pillow mint, it was placed on your pillow by the hotel cleaning staff, or for arguments sake, the hotel. The object, the mint, represents a token of the hotel's appreciation for your staying there. Sure, the mint is valued at a penny or two, but the mint really serves as a symbol of the hotel's hospitality and a vehicle for their appreciation of the customer's head that will eventually take the mint's place. <br />
          <p class="centerjourn">
           Those <italic>gratis</italic> airplane publications we all know and love serve a distinctly similar purpose to the hotel pillow mint, with distinctly similar elements of importance: (1) how the object ended up there and (2) what the objects represent.

                 (1) This one is simple enough: the airline staff, or for arguments sake, the airline. Was it some selfless do-gooder leaving these wonderful magazines behind for the next lucky sap to sit down and realize the treasure that is mere inches from their eyeballs? No. It was the staff.
               </blockquote>
               <blockquote>
                 (2) Now this is big. Why are the magazines there? In other     words, what do the objects represent? I will tell you: they are a big shiny ante-diluvian exemple of airlines once wanting to keep you entertained! Sure, you may be in a flying tube of metal shoulder to shoulder with strangers for 7 hours, but here is some paper to read. What is, was, and will rthe greatest of all these publications, you may be wondering?

                Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, mobile entertainment was fairly limited. Octogenarians will love to remind you that there was a time before Walkmans and portable DVD players, in fact even a time before airplanes existed altogether. That is a seperate arugment, for a seperate post. Given this world of limited airborne entertainment, SkyMall was the paper equivalent of a factory-sized Sharper Image. It did so, but with even more items displaying such an astonishing level of narrow usability, it would cause the eye-roll inducing "1-800 Buy Now" commercial to blush.

                As you settle in to your assigned plane seat, you queue up your "somehow-not-too-scratched-to-still-play" copy of Millennium by The Backstreet Boys. You reach forward for your copy of SkyMall, and begin to flip through its glossy pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is that a unusably rigid stainless steel wallet? Heck yes. Are your eyes deceiving you or is that a Peanuts Nativity scene? Your eyes are not playing tricks. It is all real. The glory of what used to be, of what was to never be again, was encapsulated in those pages
              </p>
              <p>
                I miss you SkyMall. You harkoned back to a simpler time. A time when it was standard flight procedure to look through the dizzying number of collectible "Lord of the Rings" rings available. You will be missed dearly, SkyMall.

          This is the first post in my brand spanking new journal, with the journal serving mainly as a mental dump for my thoughts on life. That said, the journal's wide-ranging focus will not betray its coalescing factors: technology, culture, and the pivotal role "Millenials" continue to play in driving and shaping both.
        </p>
        <p class="centerjourn">
          Tomorrow begins the beginning of the ConnectWise (CW) Tampa All-In trip, the centerpiece of the trip being a company-wide meeting. There will also be some additional opportunities to (1)meet and (2)drink with those colleagues you only half-recall from now nebulous instant messaging communications. The trip will provide a fantastic opportunity to meet colleagues from CW offices across the globe, as well as upper management. This marks not only my first "official" business trip, but also my first venture into the foreign land known to locals as Florida. Wish me luck folks.
